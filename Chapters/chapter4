You venture further into the North Block.

You observe an old man spraying paint onto a nearby brick wall.
As you approach the graffiti artist, he noticed you. His eyes light up and he nearly dances with glee,
‘We can’t let the game end so quickly, can we? It just got interesting!’ 

You walk closer to the old man, but he disappears!

A large group of monsters jump out of the brick wall!

What should you do?""")
